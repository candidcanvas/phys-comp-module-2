    <h2>Design statement</h2>
    <h3>In this module, I worked together with my group mates Belinda Chen, Zainab Ilyas, and Mikhael Ledger on an enhanced live music performance setting that explores projection mapping, Kinect interactivity, and live audio-reactive visuals using TouchDesigner. Our concept acts as a more intimate dialogue between performer and audience by providing a visual way for attendees to interact with the music they listen to. My portion for this module explored audio-reactivity for the performers, and creating ways to visualize the music they play. Mikhael focused on audience interaction with the Kinect, and Belinda and Zainab focused on conceptual work for the narratives driving our art direction for the installation.

I was able to play around with it in TouchDesigner during class, just to familiarize myself, using knowledge I already had in audio analysis after learning about it over the summer in my own time."> 
      <img src="images/Activity1/midi.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="I had also purchased a MicroLab mk3 MIDI keyboard controller to explore it as an option for performer input.

      <img src="images/Activity1/songs.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="To guide our art direction, we looked at songs that we could perform for this project. Since Mikhael plays the drums and I could switch between guitar and keyboard, we looked for songs with a nice balance of both. After discussing the overlaps in our musics tastes with everyone in the group, we agreed on A Long Dream by Korean indie band SE SO NEON.">
      <img src="images/Activity1/visuals.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="With a song selected, we went on to brainstorm what our visuals could look like. Having a song gives us a base to construct a narrative around how the song could be visualized in an abstract manner. Belinda and Zainab would later take this further with a song dissection and lyrical analysis as Mikhael and I move into technical exploration on using audio and body data input for interactions.">
      <img src="images/Activity1/audio.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="I also looked for different kinds of live visuals that I could develop. I wanted fluid motion that could flow with the song that we chose, as well as provide a base for our Kinect interaction. I was particularly interested in this tutorial (icele /, 2023), and their approach on audio analysis. While playing around with visuals, my software updated to now include Point Operators (POPs), which offers faster 3D data performance on GPU. For the purposes of this module, I hope to explore this with the final interactive design in the next module.">

Mikhael also worked on a rough scale model of the Marquee interior that shows where the windows and doors are. This was to test out where we could set up a truss and our visuals would be on the interiors using my mini projector.">

    <h2>insert prototype name here</h2>
    <p>Our proposed prototype is a live demo of one possible projector truss set up in the marquee. The live visuals are generated from input from my MIDI keyboard controller and displayed on the scaled down model of the Marquee space in the SSU on Trafalgar. At this stage, we haven’t yet integrated the Kinect for audience interactivity into our node systems, which is something that we will test in following this project. Limitations with my mini projector also meant that I could not use it as a separate display in Kantan Mapper, but the demo provided a solid proof-of-concept of what we hope to achieve in the final module.
